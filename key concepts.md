## Section 3: Basic Git Concepts

Understanding the core concepts of Git is crucial for effectively managing and collaborating on software projects. This section covers the foundational elements of Git: repositories, commits, branches, and the master/main branch.

### Repositories
A **Git repository** is a digital directory or storage space where your project's files and each file's revision history are stored. Think of it as a project's folder that Git tracks. There are two types of repositories:
- **Local repository:** Located on your computer, where you make changes or add new files.
- **Remote repository:** Hosted on the internet or network, allowing for team collaboration.

### Commits
A **commit** in Git represents a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. Commits include a commit message that describes what changes were made. They allow you to track the history of your project and revert to previous states if necessary.

### Branches
**Branches** are used in Git to develop features isolated from each other. The default branch in Git is `master` or `main`. When you make a commit, Git adds the changes to the branch you're currently on. Branches allow multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.

### The Master/Main Branch
The **master** branch (now increasingly referred to as **main** in new repositories) is the primary or default branch where the source code is considered to be in its most stable form. Features, fixes, and other branches are merged back into the master/main branch once they are tested and completed.
